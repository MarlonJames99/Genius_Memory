## Project:
This is a classic Genius memory game to play alone or with your friends!

Genius was a very popular toy in the 1980s. Distributed by Estrela, the toy sought to encourage the memorization of colors and sounds. With a shape similar to a UFO, it had colored buttons that emitted harmonic sounds and lit up in sequence. It was up to the players to repeat the process without making mistakes.

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.
In addition, I also developed media queries to adapt the application responsively to different screens and devices.<br>
I've used BEM (Block element modifier) methodology in this project.

## Next steps:
> The next step that I have planned to implement in this application are improvements related to accessibility, as it is very important that it can be used properly by everyone! <br><br>
> It's missing the favicon image.
